# Vancity Eat Smart
I wanted a way to know what I was eating at some of the major local restaurants.

Hopefully I'm not the only one who wanted this :)

Currently Have Information on:
- Cactus Club
- The Keg

If you're wondering why Earls isn't there, the pdf is formatted so badly that I can't scrape it :(

Will happily accept PRs with Earls information :)
